Hello! I'm Levi, a product manager based in Palo Alto, CA specializing in building human-centered products across web and mobile &#40;Android and iOS&#41;, and occasionally in the physical world.

Currently, I'm a junior studying [Symbolic Systems](https://www.businessinsider.com/stanford-symbolic-systems-major-alumni-2016-1?op=1#elaine-wherry-cofounded-meebo-the-social-media-platform-google-bought-for-roughly-100-million-11) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), a major designed for technical, product-oriented students who care deeply about  humanity. At Stanford, I help build [CodaLab](https://https://worksheets.codalab.org/), a web platform for sharing and reproducing published CS research results, run [TreeHacks](https://www.treehacks.com/), a premium student hackathon in the heart of silicon valley,
 and organize [#nofiltertalks](https://www.nofiltertalks.com/), an intimate local meetup that fosters unfiltered, genuine conversations with high-profile speakers.

Previously, I was a [TEC fellow](https://trueventures.com/blog/meet-the-2019-tec-fellows) at [True Ventures](https://trueventures.com/), a venture firm whose values I deeply share. As a TEC fellow, I helped build and launch a developer-facing mobile product at [Solvvy](https://solvvy.com) &#91;a True Ventures's portfolio company&#93;, whose mission is to deliver the best self-service customer experience &#91;think [Amazon Go](https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=16008589011) applied to the entire Internet&#93;. The previous summer, I had a lot of fun building enterprise software for business analysts and bankers at [Xcalar](https://xcalar.com), a 10x better Excel that can run complex operations and macros for billions of rows through drag-and-drop visual programming.


Here's a few technologies I've been working with recently:

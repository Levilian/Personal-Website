- Through the TEC fellowship with True Ventures, not only have I found a founder community where everyone is so true/genuine, willing to take risks, and aligned on values, but I also understood a little bit more about the venture business
- Venture is ultimately about people. From the end-user of the product to an employee of a portfolio company to the founder to the venture partner to the LP, everyone takes part in a role that improves the lives of people
